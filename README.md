# WeddingPlanningSystem

The aim for this project was to help make planning a wedding easier, by
registering all required tasks into the system, and each task is monitored
or managed by one person. This was my first full-stack web development project,
after I enrolled in a course called the Web Developer Bootcamp (Udemy),
and completed the whole 46-hour video course to gain all the necessary knowledge.

The code for this currently in the AWS. You can find the finished web application
[Here].
